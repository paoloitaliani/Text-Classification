# Text Multiclass Classification

### Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a model that is able to assign to a document, based on what it is about, one of the following 9 classes:  Agent, Place, Species, Work, Event, SportsSeason, UnitOfWork , TopicalConcept, Device. The data set used to train and test our models  contains 342,782 wikipedia articles and it can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/dbpedia-classes?select=DBP_wiki_data.csv). 

### Data Cleaning

One import step when we deal with textual data is the data cleaning process, that basically it aims to delete all the elements of a document that are not useful for the analysis. Let's take a look how our documents look with some examples:

```python
>>> df["text"][1]
'The 1917 Bali earthquake occurred at 06:50 local time on 21 January (23:11 on 20 January UTC). It had an estimated magnitude of 6.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale and had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused widespread damage across Bali, particularly in the south of the island. It triggered many landslides, which caused 80% of the 1500 casualties.'
